Rosalind successfully competed for funding through the [Cell and Molecular Biology Training Program](https://depts.washington.edu/cmbtg/). The goals of this NIGMS-funded (T32 GM007270) program are to support the research and scientific growth of predoctoral trainees. With support from the CMB Training Grant, Rosalind will use zebrafish as an *in vivo* model to study the dynamics and mechanisms of bone-nerve interactions. Congrats on this exciting opportunity!
