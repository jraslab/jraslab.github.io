[Emma Horton](http://jraslab.org/people/#emma-horton--research-technologist) has joined the lab as our brave first member! Emma is a recent UW grad, where she worked in [Merrill Hille's lab](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/merrill-b-hille) as an undergraduate researcher. In addition to helping the lab get off the ground, Emma will be working on mechanisms of skin patterning in juvenile zebrafish.
