Congratulations to Hana Marie Farrell-Wakelin for being named a [Mary Gates Research Scholar](https://expd.uw.edu/mge/)! Hana's project investigates the relationship between skin-resident macrophages known as Langerhans cells and neurons that innervate skin. 

The Mary Gates Endowment funds competitive scholarships with the purpose of enhancing the educational experiences of undergraduate students at the University of Washington while they are engaged in research guided by faculty. Following the period of research, Hana will present her work at the [Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://washington.edu/urs). Congrats, Hana!
