Congratulations to Tanya Brown for receiving a [National Science Foundation Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Biology](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622). The goal of these fellowships is to provide funding for new postdocs in basic sciences and provide training opportunities for future science careers. During her fellowship, Tanya will use zebrafish to investigate sensory cell biology and develop a course to teach students data analysis skills. Way to go!
