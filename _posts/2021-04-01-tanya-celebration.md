The lab took advantage of a string of nice spring weather to wish Tanya well as she begins her new position as a Research Project Manager at [Tess Research Foundation](https://www.tessresearch.org/). Tess Research is a a non-profit organization dedicated to finding treatment options for the neurological disease SLC13A5. We marked the occasion by taking our first-ever lab photo. Best of luck to Tanya as she follows her passion!
