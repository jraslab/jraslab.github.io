Eric Peterman recently attended the [18th International Workshop of Langerhans Cells  and Related Myeloid Cells of the Skin](https://pathology.wustl.edu/18th-international-workshop-on-langerhans-cells/) at Washington University in St. Louis. He presented a talk and poster on the lab's recently accepted [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.264101) examining functional roles for microtubules in Langerhans cells during directional navigation. The Langerhans cell community was very welcoming and provided great feedback and potential future directions for our zebrafish model.
