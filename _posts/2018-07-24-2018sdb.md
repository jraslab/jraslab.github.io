Jeff's research was recognized with the Hilde Mangold Postdoctoral Presentation Award at the [77th Annual SDB Meeting](http://www.sdbonline.org/2018mtg) in Portland, OR. The award was generously sponsored by [Developmental Dynamics](http://www.anatomy.org/developmental-dynamics.html) and [Chroma](https://www.chroma.com/).
