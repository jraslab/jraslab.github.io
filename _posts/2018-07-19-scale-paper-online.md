Our paper on how zebrafish scales pattern skin sensory innervation and vascularization is now online at [*Developmental Cell*](https://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/fulltext/S1534-5807(18)30504-5). The print version is scheduled for the August 6th issue. Many thanks to the generous zebrafish labs whose shared reagents made this study possible!
