Congratulations to Graham Robertson for receiving a Winter '25 [Mary Gates Research Scholarship](https://expd.uw.edu/mge/)! Graham's project investigates stem cell heterogeneity and behaviors during zebrafish post-larval skin development and regeneration. 

The Mary Gates Endowment funds competitive scholarships with the purpose of enhancing the educational experiences of undergraduate students at the University of Washington while they are engaged in research guided by faculty. Following the period of research, Graham will present his work at the [Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://washington.edu/urs). Great work, Graham!
