**Seb** - Despite being a postbac student, The Northwest Developmental Biology Meeting was my first conference presentation in the broad field of biomedical sciences. I believe I did a good job in my presentation about the regeneration potential of somatosensory neuron axons, and I hope to come back to this conference again in the future with bigger and better data! Other than being astonished by the scenery of Friday Harbor Labs, I was similarly impressed by the quality of presentations and talent of the fellow scientists in attendance. Thus, I am inspired to strive further in future developmental biology research. Altogether, I had a blast, and I am glad I was able to experience this meeting alongside fellow Rasmussen lab peers Graham and Sunny! 

**Graham** - The Northwest Developmental Biology meeting was also my first academic conference and it just blew me away. Being able to spend three days learning about other scientist’s research and telling them about my own was an incredibly special experience, and I hope to be able to attend many more conferences in the future. I’ve always been interested in my own work and that has provided some intrinsic motivation but seeing the excitement other scientists had towards my work has given me a huge burst of extrinsic motivation and has really helped to reignite my love for science. On top of all this the conference has shown me how broad communities of scientists come together, collaborate, and celebrate each other. 

**Sunny** - SDB Northwest was an incredible experience all-around. It was also my first conference (a common theme for the RasLab attendees this year), and I was stunned by the warmth and connection fostered among scientists! Despite being nervous to present my research, I was met with curiosity and genuine, constructive feedback from my peers. Additionally, Friday Harbor was an incredible setting for this conference, and Graham, Seb, and I were fortunate enough to take advantage of the beautiful scenery on a hike. I am excited beyond words for my next conference experience, and am grateful to have met this milestone with Graham and Seb!
