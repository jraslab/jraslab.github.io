The regional Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) was held once again at beautiful Friday Harbor. Congratulations to Ahlan and Sheridan for wonderful poster presentations, their first as part of the Rasmussen lab, and to Camille for winning 2nd place in the undergraduate poster competition! This meeting was a great chance to catch up with development colleagues from across the West Coast and share the beauty of the PNW, which showcased the very best of our climate with glistening waters and sparkling mountain peaks. The meeting focused on traditional model organisms like Drosophila and our beloved zebrafish; however, it was a pleasant surprise to learn about some nontraditional organisms like barnacles and snails. The group of course used our free time to frolic around the island, once again exploring the Lime Kiln tide pools and indulging in treats at a local bakery and brewery. We are excited to return next year!
