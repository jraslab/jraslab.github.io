A hearty congratulations to Sam Fernandes who was awarded a fellowship through the National Science Foundationâ€™s (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program ([GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)). The NSF GRFP recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students in STEM disciplines who are pursuing research through their graduate studies. Sam's proposal focused on studying peripheral axon regeneration in zebrafish, with a particular focus on how extrinsic cell types coordinate skin reinnervation. This award provides Sam 3 years of funding as she continues to work on her proposed project. Way to go, Sam!!!
