Evan recently received the exciting news that he was offered a fellowship through the National Science Foundationâ€™s (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program ([GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)). The NSF GRFP recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students in STEM disciplines who are pursuing research through their graduate studies. His proposal focused on studying sensory cells in the zebrafish skin, with particular focus on how cytoskeletal dynamics within these cells coordinate a sensory response. This award provides Evan 3 years of funding as he continues to work on his proposed research. Congratulations!!!
