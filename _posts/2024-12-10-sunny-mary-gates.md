Our undergraduate researcher Sunny Dighe has been awarded Autumn 2024 [Mary Gates Research Scholarships](https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/students/funding/marygates-research/) for his project studying the molecular regulation of the Merkel cell-neurite complex. These are competitive scholarships with the purpose of enhancing the educational experiences of undergraduate students at the University of Washington while they are engaged in research guided by faculty. Following the period of research, Sunny will present his work at the [Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/symposium/). Congratulations, Sunny!
