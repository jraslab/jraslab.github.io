Our first R01 application has been funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ([NICHD](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/)). This 5-year award will focus on mechanisms of sensory cell development during skin organogenesis. The grant application was truly a team effort, drawing on the key preliminary data and writing input of many early lab members. We are thankful to NICHD for this exciting opportunity and its continued support of our research.
