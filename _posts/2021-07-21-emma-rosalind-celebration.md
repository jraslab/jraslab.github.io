The lab hosted a party on the LSB deck for Emma and Rosalind. Both are leaving Seattle for the Bay Area. Emma will be starting graduate school in the [Developmental & Stem Cell Biology Ph.D. Program](https://dscb.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF. Rosalind will be starting as a K-12 teacher in San Mateo. Best of luck in Cali!
