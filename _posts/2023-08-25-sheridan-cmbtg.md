Sheridan received an award from the [Cell and Molecular Biology (CMB) Training Program](https://depts.washington.edu/cmbtg/). The goals of this NIGMS-funded (T32 GM136534) program are to support the research and scientific growth of predoctoral trainees. With support from the CMB Training Grant, Sheridan aims to investigate the form-function relationship in Merkel cells of the skin. Congratulations on this great opportunity!
