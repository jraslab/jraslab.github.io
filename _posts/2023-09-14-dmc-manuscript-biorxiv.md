Our manuscript from Evan Craig and colleagues describing dendritic Merkel cells during zebrafish skin development and regeneration is now available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.14.557830). We propose that they serve as direct precursors to mature Merkel cells. Check it out!
