The lab is excited to host Arie Aelmore for hands-on research this summer. Arie is participating in the [UW ENDURE program](http://depts.washington.edu/endure/), an NIH funded program that aims to prepare students from diverse backgrounds for neuroscience Ph.D. programs. 

We are also excited to welcome UW undergraduate Everett Fan to the lab. Everett will be working remotely on quantitative image analysis this summer in his native Hawaii.	

Welcome, Arie and Everett!
