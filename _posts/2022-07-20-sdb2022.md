The lab attended our first in-person conference since the beginning of the pandemic, the Joint Society for Developmental Biology/Pan-American Society for Evolutionary Developmental Biology Meeting in beautiful Vancouver, BC. Congrats to Evan and Camille on their successful poster presentations and Sam for scoring big in the raffle!
