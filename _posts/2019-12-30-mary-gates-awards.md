Two of our undergraduates, Ethan and Elgene, have been awarded Autumn 2019 [Mary Gates Research Scholarships](https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/students/funding/marygates-research/). These are competitive scholarships with the purpose of enhancing the educational experiences of undergraduate students at the University of Washington while they are engaged in research guided by faculty. Following the period of research, they will present their work at the Undergraduate Research Symposium. Come see their presentations on May 15th! Congratulations, Ethan and Elgene!
