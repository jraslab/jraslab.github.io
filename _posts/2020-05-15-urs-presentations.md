Well done to Elgene, Christine, and Ethan for their "lightning" research presentations at the [Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/symposium/). Each project, while working on different topics, has contributed to the rest of the lab's work and been an engaging learning experience. Thanks to the Mary Gates foundation for hosting the presentations and making it work virtually in these socially distanced times!
