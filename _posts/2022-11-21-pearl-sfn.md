Pearl attended the 51st annual Society for Neuroscience conference in San Diego, her first ever conference! She presented her poster on calcium signaling in Langerhans cells, a type of Zebrafish skin-resident immune cell. Her poster was a part of the conferenceâ€™s diversity poster session, highlighting programs which encourage diversity in research. Special thanks to the NIH-funded UW-ENDURE program which made this trip possible for her!
