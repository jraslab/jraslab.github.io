Ahlan Ferdous recently attended the 11th Conference of The Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition International Association ([TEMTIA 11](https://alleninstitute.org/events/temtia-2024/)), held at the Allen Cell Institute in Seattle. This biennial conference brings together researchers around the world to discuss cutting-edge research on the role of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions in various developmental and disease contexts. 

At the conference, Ahlan presented a poster about her preliminary findings on potential EMT during Merkel cell development in zebrafish. Her presentation earned a **Best Poster Award**, sponsored by TEMTIA 11 and the [*Cells Tissues Organs*](https://karger.com/cto) journal. Congratulations, Ahlan!
