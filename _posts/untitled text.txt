The Tg(mpeg1:Brainbow)w201 line was generated by cloning the Brainbow 1.0L cassette (Livet et al., 2007
) (Addgene) into a Tol2 plasmid containing the zebrafish mpeg1 promoter (Ellett et al., 2011
). 

Ectopic expression of follistatin in chick neural tube. Vectors encoding follistatin and GFP were introduced into chick neural tube by in ovo electroporation and the effect on expression of marker proteins was assayed 48 hours later. All images are orientated with the electroporated side to the right. The non-electroporated (left) side serves as a control.

(A-D) Representative examples of neurulating embryos unilaterally microinjected at the 16-cell stage with 1.8 pmol Folr1-MO along with GFP mRNA in the dorsal medial (A-C) or dorsal lateral (D) animal blastomeres, as indicated in drawings on the right, sectioned and processed for Sox2, neural progenitor marker (blue), Folr1 (green), GFP (red) and Î²-tubulin (white) immunostaining. Red indicates Folr1-MO-containing cells.

And for slides, I had planned on starting with the skin as a physical barrier and as a sensory organ, move into innervation and immunoregulation within the skin, and finish with skin pathologies/peripheral neuropathies before jumping into how LCs/skin cells/neurons can possibly interact and my aims. I know that's all kind of vague, but if you have anything along those lines, that'd be swell.
