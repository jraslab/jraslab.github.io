Dr. Ahlan Ferdous attended the [19th International Zebrafish Society Conference](https://www.izfs.org/education/19izfc) in Madison, Wisconsin in July 2025. She was awarded the Moon Travel fellowship by the [Institute of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine](https://iscrm.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington. The Moon Travel Fellowship honors the legacy of [Dr. Randy Moon](https://iscrm.uw.edu/stories/moon/), a leader in the Seattle developmental biology community.

The zebrafish conference gathered an international community of scientists to share the latest advances in fish research, covering topics from developmental biology and genetics to disease modeling and emerging technologies. During the meeting, Ahlan presented a poster highlighting her research on the mechanisms of Merkel cell development and regeneration, using the adult zebrafish epidermis as a novel model. The event provided her with opportunities to attend inspiring keynote lectures, learn about the latest innovative and useful methodologies, and network with experts and peers in the field.
