Jeff just returned from the 2019 [NICHD](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/) Career Planning and Networking Workshop. The workshop featured a veritable who's who of developmental biology. [Cliff Tabin](https://tabin.hms.harvard.edu/) spoke on signals and forces involved in chick intestinal smooth muscle morphogenesis. [Marnie Halpern](https://emb.carnegiescience.edu/science/faculty/marnie-halpern) presented her lab's work on left-right asymmetries in zebrafish brain development and function. [Michael Barresi](https://sophia.smith.edu/blog/barresilab/) shared his lab's work on morphogenesis and colonization of the CNS in zebrafish. [Irene Zohn](https://childrensnational.org/research-and-education/center-for-neuroscience-research/research-laboratories/zohn-laboratory) spoke on how she is using mouse genetics to understand human neural tube birth defects. A combination of short talks and "elevator talks" from trainees highlighted the future of Developmental Biology research. Thanks to the organizers for putting together a fantastic meeting!
