The lab is thrilled to welcome Pearl Leon Guerrero-Mcinally for hands-on research this summer. Pearl is a rising UW junior participating in the [UW ENDURE program](http://depts.washington.edu/endure/), an NIH funded program that aims to prepare students from diverse backgrounds for neuroscience Ph.D. programs.
