Held this year at the beautiful Friday Harbor UW campus, the regional Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) meeting allowed us to connect with many old friends in the Development community. The cozy social hours facilitated some awesome conversations, which helped sprout lots of new project ideas. Congrats to Camille and Erik for great poster presentations, and Sam for winning 2nd place in the graduate poster competition! We got to explore the island, where the shoreline and tidepools were a hit with the group. Camille brought a frisbee, which allowed us to enjoy an extended frisbee session in the spring sunshine. We will definitely be back next year!
