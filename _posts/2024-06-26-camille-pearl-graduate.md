The lab celebrated two recent graduates from the lab. 
* Pearl finished her undergraduate degree in biochemistry with an honors thesis. We celebrated with a kayak on Lake Washington through the arboretum. 
* Camille wrapped up her time as a research tech as she moves on to graduate school at CU-Anschutz. We celebrated with a potluck.
