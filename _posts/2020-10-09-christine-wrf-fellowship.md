Christine was selected to receive a Washington Research Foundation Fellowship ([WRFF](https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/students/funding/wrff/)) for the 2020-21 academic year. The goal of the WRFF is to support undergraduates working on creative and sophisticated research projects in the biosciences. WRF Fellows are also funded to present their work at professional conferences. Christine will continue to use zebrafish to explore the dynamics of neurons and skins cells within the context of injury.
