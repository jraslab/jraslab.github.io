Congratulations to Christine Dien for receiving a [Mary Gates Research Scholarship](https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/students/funding/marygates-research/). The Mary Gates Awards enhance the educational experiences of undergraduate students at the University of Washington while they are engaged in research. Hopefully Christine will have the (virtual?) opportunity to present her work at the [Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/symposium/) this spring. Well done, Christine!
