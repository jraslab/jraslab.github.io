Camille received a JOINT award from the National Institute of Genetics (NIG) to work with the [Kawakami Lab](https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/research/organization-top/organization/kawakami) in Japan! This opportunity has allowed her to travel to the lab to shelf screen and identify new tools that we are excited to bring to our lab.
