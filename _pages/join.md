## Lab environment
The projects in the lab are, by nature, quite interdisciplinary (blending developmental biology, neuroscience, regeneration, and disease modeling). To tackle these projects we use a variety of *in vivo* and *in silico* techniques. Lab members are expected to work hard, ask questions, and have fun doing science.

We seek to recruit trainees from diverse backgrounds and with diverse skill sets. We take a [growth mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/) approach to mentorship and aim to develop new skills based on individuals' goals and projects. The lab actively engages with the zebrafish, developmental biology, and neuroscience communities in Seattle. Lab members have a variety of opportunities to present their work and network within this broad community (departmental meetings, joint lab meetings, local and regional meetings). 

## Postdoctoral fellows
The lab is actively recruiting postdocs. Interested candidates should send a brief cover letter and CV to Jeff ![contact](/assets/images/contact.png)

## Graduate students
Grad students should apply through the [Biology](https://www.biology.washington.edu/programs/graduate), [MCB](http://mcb-seattle.edu/), or [Neuroscience](http://depts.washington.edu/neurogrd/) programs. Students interested in the lab are encouraged to contact Jeff prior to applying. Potential rotation projects currently include:
* Developmental patterning of sensory structures
* RNAseq profiling of skin cell types in various genetic backgrounds
* Imaging tissue and nerve regeneration 

## Research technicians
Please check back soon. Future openings will be posted here.

## Undergraduate students
Please check back after winter quarter. Future openings will be posted here and in the [URP database](https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/students/find/).
