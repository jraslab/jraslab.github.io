## The big picture
How organisms establish and maintain complex cellular architectures is a fundamental 
problem in biology. Our skin is a sensory organ innervated by a fascinating array of 
intricately patterned somatosensory axon endings. Loss of sensory function in the skin is debilitating and associated with common genetic and acquired disorders, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Thus, understanding the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in somatosensory axon development and repair will have important disease implications.

## Why zebrafish skin?
Whereas many of the key events in skin organogenesis occur *in utero* in mammals -- making them relatively inaccessible -- the external development of zebrafish allows for facile observation and manipulation of maturing skin. The Rasmussen lab has developed the zebrafish skin as a powerful genetic system to study nerve remodeling in a 
living vertebrate with single-cell resolution. Since zebrafish can regenerate almost any adult structure ([Rasmussen and Sagasti, 2017](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940084)), they are an excellent system for identifying mechanisms of successful 
tissue repair. 

## Project 1: How is vertebrate skin innervation patterned?
![image-right](/assets/images/Fig3-scales-rni-300.png){: .align-right} As animals mature from embryonic to adult stages, the skin grows and adds epithelial 
strata, specialized cells and dermal appendages, like hair, glands and scales (see 
figure). How cutaneous axons adapt to these dramatic changes is poorly understood. By 
examining juvenile fish, the lab previously discovered that skin innervation dramatically remodels following appendage development. In contrast to the simplified larval innervation 
pattern, which is driven by growth and repulsion of naked axon endings, adult axons enter 
the epidermis as evenly spaced nerves, suggesting an alternative mechanism for spacing 
axon endings in adult skin. Adult sensory nerves contain Schwann cells, blood vessels and 
osteoblasts, and a subset of dermal osteoblasts independently guide nerves 
and blood vessels during development and regeneration. By preventing scale regeneration 
and examining mutants lacking scales, we showed that scales coordinate axon remodeling and 
skin maturation ([Rasmussen et al., 2018](https://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/fulltext/S1534-5807(18)30504-5)). Since many animals have regularly spaced dermal appendages related to scales, these results raise the intriguing possibility that skin appendages may provide a general mechanism for patterning 
innervation during organogenesis.

## Project 2: How do skin phagocytes contribute to tissue repair?
![image-right](/assets/images/Fig1-phago-v3-300.png){: .align-right} The skin is our largest sensory organ, and axons that innervate the skin are frequently 
damaged. Removal of cellular debris is essential for tissue repair, but the mechanisms 
used to repair sensory endings are not well understood. By using live imaging and laser 
axotomy in larval zebrafish, we made the unexpected finding that keratinocytes, not 
macrophages, eat axon debris following injury (see figure). Keratinocytes eat several 
additional types of cellular debris ([Rasmussen et al., 2015](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589751)), 
suggesting that keratinocyte phagocytosis may play a broad, yet underappreciated, role in 
tissue repair. We are currently extending these studies to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate axon removal in the more complex adult skin.
