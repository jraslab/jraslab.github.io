## The big picture
I am broadly interested in the mechanisms that promote nerve and tissue plasticity during 
development and following injury. Nerves have an extraordinary ability to adapt to 
dramatic changes in their target territories as organs grow and mature during 
development, thus maintaining neuronal connectivity and function. Remarkably, 
regenerating nerves can also reactivate developmental programs to reinnervate their 
targets following damage. Nerve regeneration not only promotes the restoration of 
neuronal function, but is also required for tissue regeneration in diverse contexts.

## Why zebrafish skin?
![image-right](/assets/images/Fig3-scales-rni-300.png){: .align-right} The skin is densely innervated and uniquely accessible for observation, biopsy and 
experimentation, making it an excellent model for examining regeneration and repair. 
Although the skin and its appendages have remarkable growth and regenerative potential, 
sensory repair in humans is often incomplete following skin injury, and sensory loss is a 
major complication associated with diabetes and chemotherapy. Zebrafish can regenerate 
almost any adult structure, making them an excellent system for identifying 
mechanisms of successful tissue repair. I have found that skin reinnervation following 
injury requires appendage regeneration and identified the cells that remove damaged axons 
from the skin. As an independent investigator, I plan to extend these studies by using 
the unique experimental advantages of zebrafish to dissect the signals that govern tissue 
remodeling and repair.

## Project 1: How is vertebrate skin innervation patterned?
As animals mature from embryonic to adult stages, the skin grows and adds epithelial 
strata, specialized cells and dermal appendages, like hair, glands and scales (see 
Figure). How cutaneous axons adapt to these dramatic changes is poorly understood. By 
examining juvenile fish, I discovered that skin innervation dramatically remodels 
following appendage development. In contrast to the simplified larval innervation 
pattern, which is driven by growth and repulsion of naked axon endings, adult axons enter 
the epidermis as evenly spaced nerves, suggesting an alternative mechanism for spacing 
axon endings in adult skin. Adult sensory nerves contain Schwann cells, blood vessels and 
osteoblasts, and I found that a subset of dermal osteoblasts independently guide nerves 
and blood vessels during development and regeneration. By preventing scale regeneration 
and examining mutants lacking scales, I showed that scales coordinate axon remodeling and 
skin maturation (Rasmussen et al., 2018 *Dev Cell*). Since many animals have regularly 
spaced dermal appendages related to scales, these results raise the intriguing 
possibility that skin appendages may provide a general mechanism for patterning 
innervation during organogenesis.

## Project 2: How do skin phagocytes contribute to tissue repair?
![image-right](/assets/images/Fig1-phago-v3-300.png){: .align-right}The skin is our largest sensory organ, and axons that innervate the skin are frequently 
damaged. Removal of cellular debris is essential for tissue repair, but the mechanisms 
used to repair sensory endings are not well understood. By using live imaging and laser 
axotomy in larval zebrafish, I made the unexpected finding that keratinocytes, not 
macrophages, eat axon debris following injury. Keratinocytes eat several 
additional types of cellular debris (Rasmussen et al., 2015 *J Neurosci*), 
suggesting that keratinocyte phagocytosis may play a broad, yet underappreciated, role in 
tissue repair.

To identify the phagocytes for degenerating axons in the more complex adult skin, I found 
that plucking and culturing a scale from an adult is a simple technique to study axon 
degeneration in the presence of all resident skin cell types. Live imaging of plucked 
scales revealed that, in contrast to larval skin, keratinocytes were only partially 
responsible for clearing axon debris in adults. Surprisingly, I found that Langerhans 
cells (LCs), skin-resident immune cells that are primarily thought to protect against 
foreign pathogens, also eat axon debris. Although LCs were first described over 100 years 
ago and have been shown to respond to axon-derived small peptides, this is the first 
demonstration that LCs play a role in tissue repair.
