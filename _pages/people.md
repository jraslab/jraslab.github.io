## Jeff Rasmussen, PhD – [WRF](http://www.wrfseattle.org/) Distinguished Investigator
![image-left](https://www.biology.washington.edu/sites/default/files/styles/portrait/public/JeffRas-Headshot-UWBiol.jpg){: .align-left} I grew up in Ithaca, NY and received a BS in Computational Biology from Brown University. I then joined [Alexander Rudensky’s](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/alexander-rudensky) group at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I studied the development of regulatory T cells as a post-bac. 

I continued my interest in developmental biology as an [MCB](https://depts.washington.edu/mcb/) graduate student in [Jim Priess’](http://research.fhcrc.org/priess/en.html) lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where I discovered novel mechanisms of epithelial tube formation in *C. elegans* embryos.

As a postdoc in [Alvaro Sagasti’s](https://www.mcdb.ucla.edu/Research/Sagasti/Sagasti_lab_home.html) lab at UCLA, I focused on how sensory axons in the skin remodel in the face of a constantly changing tissue environment. My postdoctoral studies were supported by the [Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund](http://www.jccfund.org/) and a [K99/R00](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9229568&icde=38773434) award. Outside of lab, I enjoy running – for exercise and to keep up with my kids.

## Emma Horton – Research Technologist
![image-left](/assets/images/Emma-web.jpg){: .align-left} I was raised in the Pacific Northwest and loved it so much I decided to stick around for college and now for post undergrad work. I received two majors from the University of Washington, one in Biochemistry and the other in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. I have plans to attend graduate school in the future, but I am currently continuing my stay at UW as a lab tech on Jeff Rasmussen's team investigating epidermal interactions with axons. Outside of academia, my hobbies include singing/songwriting, anything crafty, and snowboarding as much as possible. 

## Want to join the lab?
**The lab is looking for enthusiastic and hard-working scientists at all levels!** Grad students should apply through the [Biology](https://www.biology.washington.edu/programs/graduate) or [MCB](http://mcb-seattle.edu/) graduate programs. Interested postdocs should send a short introductory email along with your CV to Jeff.
