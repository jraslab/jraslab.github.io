## Jeff Rasmussen, PhD – [WRF](http://www.wrfseattle.org/) Distinguished Investigator
![image-left](https://www.biology.washington.edu/sites/default/files/styles/portrait/public/JeffRas-Headshot-UWBiol.jpg){: .align-left} Jeff grew up in Ithaca, NY and received a BS in Computational Biology from Brown University. Jeff then joined [Alexander Rudensky's](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/alexander-rudensky) group at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he studied the development of regulatory T cells as a post-bac. 

Jeff continued his interest in developmental biology as an [MCB](https://depts.washington.edu/mcb/) graduate student and [ARCS](http://www.seattlearcsfoundation.org/) scholar in [Jim Priess'](http://research.fhcrc.org/priess/en.html) lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where he discovered novel mechanisms of epithelial tube formation in *C. elegans* embryos.

As a postdoc in [Alvaro Sagasti's](https://www.mcdb.ucla.edu/Research/Sagasti/Sagasti_lab_home.html) lab at UCLA, he focused on how sensory axons in the skin remodel in the face of a constantly changing tissue environment. His postdoctoral studies were supported by the [Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund](http://www.jccfund.org/) and a [K99/R00](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9229568&icde=38773434) award. Outside of lab, he enjoys running – for exercise and to keep up with his kids.

## Rosalind Bump – [MCB](https://depts.washington.edu/mcb/) Graduate Student
![image-left](/assets/images/Rosalind-web.jpg){: .align-left} Rosalind earned her BS in Molecular Environmental Biology from UC Berkeley, where she became fascinated by ecosystem dynamics, public health equity, and tissue regeneration alike. After graduation, she moved to San Diego to work in [Jesse Dixon's](https://dixon.salk.edu/) lab at the Salk Institute. There, she delved into the world of chromatin architecture and genomics, riddling through ways to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric leukemias. Rosalind is thrilled to be in Seattle, and to be back exploring development in a fish model system with the Rasmussen Lab! She’s eager to be hiking new trails, searching for live jazz, and learning as much as she can about somatosensory neurons.

Rosalind is currently funded by the [Cell and Molecular Biology Training Program](https://depts.washington.edu/cmbtg/). <a href="https://twitter.com/rosbump"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

## Evan Craig – [Biology](https://www.biology.washington.edu/programs/graduate) Graduate Student
![image-left](/assets/images/Evan-web.jpg){: .align-left} Evan obtained his bachelor’s degree in cell biology while participating as a student-athlete for Rockhurst University’s men’s soccer team. Upon graduation, he worked as a research tech in [Prachee Avasthi's](http://www.avasthilab.org/) lab at KU Medical Center where he confirmed his passion for cell biology and microscopy while studying *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*, a single-celled, eukaryotic algae.  His research focused on visualizing the *Chlamydomonas* actin cytoskeleton and characterizing the role of actin-nucleating formin proteins in this algae. He's excited to apply his background in cytoskeletal dynamics to a developmental model and learn zebrafish imaging techniques. Outside of lab, Evan loves to go on long runs, play guitar, and pick up any book written by Haruki Murakami.

## Emma Horton – Research Technologist
![image-left](/assets/images/Emma-web.jpg){: .align-left} Emma was raised in the Pacific Northwest and loved it so much she decided to stick around for college and now for post undergrad work. She received two degrees from the University of Washington, one in Biochemistry and the other in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. She has plans to attend graduate school in the future, but she is currently continuing her stay at UW as a lab tech on Jeff Rasmussen's team investigating epidermal interactions with axons. Outside of academia, her hobbies include singing/songwriting, anything crafty, and snowboarding as much as possible. 

## Eric Peterman, PhD – [WRF](http://wrfseattle.org/fellows.php) Postdoctoral Fellow
![image-left](/assets/images/Eric-web.jpg){: .align-left} Eric attended the University of Maine where he obtained an undergraduate and a Master’s degree. It was during this time he was initially introduced to using zebrafish as a model organism in the lab of [Carol Kim](https://gsbse.umaine.edu/people/carol-kim/), studying innate immune responses to bacterial infection using larval zebrafish. Following this, he attended the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and obtained his Ph.D. in the lab of [Rytis Prekeris](https://www.prekerislab.com/), where he moved into cell culture and studied cell division and the role of the post-mitotic midbody. He is excited to return to using zebrafish as a model, in which he’ll be studying Langerhans cells and reinnervation at sites of skin injury. Outside of lab, Eric enjoys dong all-things outdoors with his wife, daughter, and dog.

## Elgene Quitevis – Research Technologist
![image-left](/assets/images/Elgene-web.jpg){: .align-left} Elgene is a recent graduate of the UW, with a dual degree in Biochemistry and Biology (Molecular, Cellular & Developmental). His project revolves around tool building by constructing genetic reporters for analysis of skin/neuron development and repair.  In his free time, Elgene enjoys a wide variety of things. From attempting to learn new concepts from different scientific disciplines (e.g., quantum mechanics, advanced mathematics, etc.) by browsing the internet and reading scientific papers to trivia quizzes, playing videogames, collecting memes and playing the violin. He recently has taken up learning to play the piano and programming with an interest in data science, machine learning and simulations.

## Nathaniel Yee – Undergraduate Researcher
![image-left](/assets/images/Nathaniel-web.jpg){: .align-left} Nathaniel is an undergraduate at the University of Washington who is currently undeclared, but is interested in majoring in biology. 

Nathaniel is currently working on understanding the dynamic characteristics of Merkel cells in the epidermal environment of zebrafish.

Outside of lab, Nathaniel enjoys chess, working out, eating really good pasta, and watching football.
