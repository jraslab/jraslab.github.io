## Jeff Rasmussen, PhD – [WRF](http://www.wrfseattle.org/) Distinguished Investigator
![image-left](https://www.biology.washington.edu/sites/default/files/styles/portrait/public/JeffRas-Headshot-UWBiol.jpg){: .align-left} Jeff grew up in Ithaca, NY and received a BS in Computational Biology from Brown University. Jeff then joined [Alexander Rudensky’s](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/alexander-rudensky) group at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he studied the development of regulatory T cells as a post-bac. 

Jeff continued his interest in developmental biology as an [MCB](https://depts.washington.edu/mcb/) graduate student and [ARCS](http://www.seattlearcsfoundation.org/) scholar in [Jim Priess’](http://research.fhcrc.org/priess/en.html) lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where he discovered novel mechanisms of epithelial tube formation in *C. elegans* embryos.

As a postdoc in [Alvaro Sagasti’s](https://www.mcdb.ucla.edu/Research/Sagasti/Sagasti_lab_home.html) lab at UCLA, he focused on how sensory axons in the skin remodel in the face of a constantly changing tissue environment. His postdoctoral studies were supported by the [Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund](http://www.jccfund.org/) and a [K99/R00](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9229568&icde=38773434) award. Outside of lab, he enjoys running – for exercise and to keep up with his kids.

## Tanya Brown, PhD - Postdoctoral Scholar
![image-left](/assets/images/Tanya-web.jpg){: .align-left} Tanya attended the University of Washington where she gained her first experience in research as an undergraduate studying dorsal root ganglia development in Dave Raible’s lab. After graduating, Tanya joined John Incardona’s group at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center investigating the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on cardiac development in pelagic fish species. She then completed her Ph.D. at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus where she studied oligodendrocyte and myelin development in Wendy Macklin’s lab. She is excited to be back in the pacific northwest as a Husky to learn about the development of Merkel cells. Other than developmental biology, Tanya is also very interested in improving science education. She enjoys running, learning photography, and exploring the outdoors.

## Rosalind Bump – MCB Rotation Student
![image-left](/assets/images/Rosalind-web.jpg){: .align-left} Rosalind is a first year graduate student in the UW MCB program. She earned her BS in Molecular Environmental Biology from UC Berkeley, where she became fascinated by ecosystem dynamics, public health equity, and tissue regeneration alike. 

After graduation, she moved to San Diego to work in Jesse Dixon's lab at the Salk Institute. There, she delved into the world of chromatin architecture and genomics, riddling through ways to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric leukemias.

Rosalind is thrilled to be in Seattle, and to be back exploring development in a fish model system with the Rasmussen Lab! She’s eager to be hiking new trails, searching for live jazz, and learning as much as she can about somatosensory neurons.

## Christine Dien – Undergraduate Researcher
![image-left](/assets/images/Christine-web.jpg){: .align-left} Christine grew up in the Pacific Northwest and is currently a sophomore planning to major in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. Her project in the lab investigates what molecules and pathways control the interactions between skin cells and sensory nerve endings with RNAseq analysis techniques. She is also interested in finding similarities between zebrafish and mammalian sensory neurons. Outside of lab, Christine enjoys drawing, painting, 3D modeling, and baking! 

## Emma Horton – Research Technologist
![image-left](/assets/images/Emma-web.jpg){: .align-left} Emma was raised in the Pacific Northwest and loved it so much she decided to stick around for college and now for post undergrad work. She received two degrees from the University of Washington, one in Biochemistry and the other in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. She has plans to attend graduate school in the future, but she is currently continuing her stay at UW as a lab tech on Jeff Rasmussen's team investigating epidermal interactions with axons. Outside of academia, her hobbies include singing/songwriting, anything crafty, and snowboarding as much as possible. 

## Eric Peterman, PhD – [WRF](http://wrfseattle.org/fellows.php) Postdoctoral Fellow
![image-left](/assets/images/Eric-web.jpg){: .align-left} Eric attended the University of Maine where he obtained an undergraduate and a Master’s degree. It was during this time he was initially introduced to using zebrafish as a model organism in the lab of Carol Kim, studying innate immune responses to bacterial infection using larval zebrafish. Following this, he attended the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and obtained his Ph.D. in the lab of Rytis Prekeris, where he moved into cell culture and studied cell division and the role of the post-mitotic midbody. He is excited to return to using zebrafish as a model, in which he’ll be studying Langerhans cells and reinnervation at sites of skin injury. Outside of lab, Eric enjoys dong all-things outdoors with his wife, daughter, and dog.

## Elgene Quitevis – Undergraduate Researcher
![image-left](/assets/images/Elgene-web.jpg){: .align-left} Elgene is a senior majoring in Biochemistry and Biology (Molecular, Cellular & Developmental). His project revolves around tool building by constructing genetic reporters for genes suspected to be involved in axon guidance within the zebrafish epidermis.  In his free time, Elgene enjoys a wide variety of things. From attempting to learn new concepts from different scientific disciplines (e.g. quantum mechanics, advanced mathematics etc.) by browsing the internet and reading scientific papers to trivia quizzes, playing videogames, collecting memes and playing the violin. He recently has taken up learning to play the piano and programming with an interest in data science, machine learning and simulations.

## Ethan White – Undergraduate Researcher
![image-left](/assets/images/Ethan-web.jpg){: .align-left} Ethan is an undergraduate at the University of Washington studying Biochemistry. His future plans include graduating spring 2020 and attending graduate school. 

His project studies Langerhans Cells within the zebrafish epidermis and their effect on tissue repair. 

Outside of the lab he loves to play saxophone, soccer, and read science fiction novels.
