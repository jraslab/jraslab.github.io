## Jeff Rasmussen, PhD
![image-left](/assets/images/jeff.jpg){: .align-left} I grew up in Ithaca, NY and received a BS in Computational Biology from Brown University. I then joined [Alexander Rudensky’s](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/alexander-rudensky) group at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I studied the development of regulatory T cells as a post-bac. 

I continued my interest in developmental biology as a graduate student in [Jim Priess’](http://research.fhcrc.org/priess/en.html) lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where I discovered novel mechanisms of epithelial tube formation in *C. elegans* embryos.

As a postdoc in [Alvaro Sagasti’s](https://www.mcdb.ucla.edu/Research/Sagasti/Sagasti_lab_home.html) lab at UCLA, I focused on how sensory axons in the skin remodel in the face of a constantly changing tissue environment. My postdoctoral studies were supported by the [Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund](http://www.jccfund.org/) and a [K99/R00](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9229568&icde=38773434) award. Outside of lab, I enjoy running – for exercise and to keep up with my kids.

## Want to join the lab?
The lab is looking for enthusiastic and hard-working scientists at all levels! If you are interested in joining the lab, please send a short introductory email along with your CV to Jeff.
