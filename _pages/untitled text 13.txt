What are the cellular origins of Merkel cells? Analysis of Merkel cell progenitors have come to conflicting results in avians and rodents. Quail/chick chimeras suggest a neural crest origin for avian Merkel cells \cite{Grim:2000aa}, whereas lineage tracing studies of mouse Merkel cells indicate an epidermal origin \cite{Van-Keymeulen:2009aa,Morrison:2009aa}. Analysis of the zMC lineage will address fundamental questions about their progenitors and allow us to compare and contrast skin maturation in zebrafish with other vertebrates.\medskip 

In preliminary studies, we used epidermal Sox2 staining as a proxy for Merkel cell fate, since essentially all zMCs express Sox2 (Figure \ref{fig:molecular}B,D). To investigate a possible neural crest origin of zMCs, we stained a \textit{sox10:Cre}-based neural crest lineage reporter for Sox2 \cite{Kague:2012aa}. However, we observed no colocalization between Sox2 staining and the neural crest reporter (n=0/150 Sox2+ cells expressed the reporter). This observation indicates that zMCs derive from a non-neural crest lineage.\medskip 

To investigate a possible epidermal origin, we considered basal keratinocytes, an epidermal stem cell population, the most likely candidate progenitors. To follow this lineage, we engineered a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the basal keratinocyte marker \textit{\textDelta Np63} to express a zebrafish-optimized, tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase \citep[CreERT2;][]{Kesavan:2018aa} (Figure \ref{fig:lineage}A). We treated BAC-injected F\textsubscript{0} animals with the tamoxifen metabolite 4-OHT at 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to induce Cre activity, which resulted in permanent DsRed expression in basal keratinocytes and their derivatives (Figure \ref{fig:lineage}A). We raised injected animals to adulthood and observed extensive co-labeling between the basal cell lineage reporter and Sox2 (Figure \ref{fig:lineage}B,C). These preliminary observations are consistent with an epidermal origin of zMCs.

Embryos from this cross will be treated with \SI{10}{\micro\molar} 4-OHT at 24 hpf to induce permanent DsRed expression in basal keratinocytes and derivatives (Figure \ref{fig:cre}B). We will raise treated animals until scales develop and determine the number of zMCs derived from basal keratinocytes by quantifying GFP+/DsRed+ cells. If our hypothesis is correct, we expect that most or all zMCs (depending on the efficiency of recombination) will be DsRed+.\medskip 

(A) Strategy for permanent, genetic labeling of the basal keratinocyte lineage. Upon Cre activation with 4-OHT, \textDelta Np63+ basal keratinocytes stably express DsRed from the ubiquitous \textit{actb2} promoter. An early, high dose of 4-OHT will lead to widespread DsRed expression in the epidermis (B), whereas a late, low dose of 4-OHT will lead to DsRed expression in single basal cells (C).

(B,C) Immunostaining of scale epidermis for Sox2. Arrow, presumptive keratinocyte. Arrowheads, presumptive zMCs expressing both Sox2 and the basal cell lineage reporter (n=26/105 Sox2+ cells expressed the basal cell lineage reporter). A trivial explanation for this observation would be that zMCs express \textDelta Np63. However, we found no evidence for \textDelta Np63 expression in zMCs (n = 0/57 Atoh1a+ cells stained positive with an anti-p63 antibody).
