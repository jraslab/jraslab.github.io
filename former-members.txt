## Tanya Brown, PhD – [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622) Postdoctoral Fellow
![image-left](/assets/images/Tanya-web.jpg){: .align-left} Tanya attended the University of Washington where she gained her first experience in research as an undergraduate studying dorsal root ganglia development in [Dave Raible's](https://depts.washington.edu/biostr/people/raible-david) lab. After graduating, Tanya joined [John Incardona's](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/contact/display_staffprofile.cfm?staffid=697) group at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center investigating the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on cardiac development in pelagic fish species. She then completed her Ph.D. at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus where she studied oligodendrocyte and myelin development in [Wendy Macklin's](http://www.macklinlab.com/) lab. She is excited to be back in the pacific northwest as a Husky to learn about the development of Merkel cells. Other than developmental biology, Tanya is also very interested in improving science education. She enjoys running, learning photography, and exploring the outdoors.

## Avery A Swearer – [MCB](https://depts.washington.edu/mcb/) Graduate Student
![image-left](/assets/images/Avery-web.jpg){: .align-left} Avery earned her BA in Biology from Carleton College in Minnesota, where she was introduced to lab biology while researching snake phylogenies. After a summer at the University of Minnesota, she became fascinated by developmental and regenerative biology. After graduation, she moved to Bethesda, Maryland to work in [Brant Weinstein's lab](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/atNICHD/Investigators/weinstein) at the [NICHD](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/) where she explored fat development in Mexican cave fish and characterized epigenetic changes during zebrafish heart regeneration. She's loved exploring the Pacific Northwest during her first year of graduate school but she's excited to get back to zebrafish regeneration research while rotating in the Rasmussen Lab this spring. In her free time Avery loves hiking, playing with her cat, and making any type of craft she can find!

## Christine Dien – Undergraduate Researcher
![image-left](/assets/images/Christine-web.jpg){: .align-left} Christine grew up in the Pacific Northwest and is currently a sophomore planning to major in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. Her project in the lab investigates what molecules and pathways control the interactions between skin cells and sensory nerve endings with RNAseq analysis techniques. She is also interested in finding similarities between zebrafish and mammalian sensory neurons. Outside of lab, Christine enjoys drawing, painting, 3D modeling, and baking! <a href="https://twitter.com/christine_dien"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

## Rosalind Bump – [MCB](https://depts.washington.edu/mcb/) Graduate Student
![image-left](/assets/images/Rosalind-web.jpg){: .align-left} Rosalind earned her BS in Molecular Environmental Biology from UC Berkeley, where she became fascinated by ecosystem dynamics, public health equity, and tissue regeneration alike. After graduation, she moved to San Diego to work in [Jesse Dixon's](https://dixon.salk.edu/) lab at the Salk Institute. There, she delved into the world of chromatin architecture and genomics, riddling through ways to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric leukemias. Rosalind is thrilled to be in Seattle, and to be back exploring development in a fish model system with the Rasmussen Lab! She’s eager to be hiking new trails, searching for live jazz, and learning as much as she can about somatosensory neurons.

Rosalind is currently funded by the [Cell and Molecular Biology Training Program](https://depts.washington.edu/cmbtg/). <a href="https://twitter.com/rosbump"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

## Emma Horton – Research Technologist
![image-left](/assets/images/Emma-web.jpg){: .align-left} Emma was raised in the Pacific Northwest and loved it so much she decided to stick around for college and now for post undergrad work. She received two degrees from the University of Washington, one in Biochemistry and the other in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. She has plans to attend graduate school in the future, but she is currently continuing her stay at UW as a lab tech on Jeff Rasmussen's team investigating epidermal interactions with axons. Outside of academia, her hobbies include singing/songwriting, anything crafty, and snowboarding as much as possible.
