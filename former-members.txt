## Avery A Swearer – [MCB](https://depts.washington.edu/mcb/) Graduate Student
![image-left](/assets/images/Avery-web.jpg){: .align-left} Avery earned her BA in Biology from Carleton College in Minnesota, where she was introduced to lab biology while researching snake phylogenies. After a summer at the University of Minnesota, she became fascinated by developmental and regenerative biology. After graduation, she moved to Bethesda, Maryland to work in [Brant Weinstein's lab](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/atNICHD/Investigators/weinstein) at the [NICHD](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/) where she explored fat development in Mexican cave fish and characterized epigenetic changes during zebrafish heart regeneration. She's loved exploring the Pacific Northwest during her first year of graduate school but she's excited to get back to zebrafish regeneration research while rotating in the Rasmussen Lab this spring. In her free time Avery loves hiking, playing with her cat, and making any type of craft she can find!
