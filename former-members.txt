![image-left](/assets/images/Tanya-web.jpg){: .align-left} Tanya attended the University of Washington where she gained her first experience in research as an undergraduate studying dorsal root ganglia development in [Dave Raible's](https://depts.washington.edu/biostr/people/raible-david) lab. After graduating, Tanya joined [John Incardona's](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/contact/display_staffprofile.cfm?staffid=697) group at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center investigating the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on cardiac development in pelagic fish species. She then completed her Ph.D. at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus where she studied oligodendrocyte and myelin development in [Wendy Macklin's](http://www.macklinlab.com/) lab. She is excited to be back in the pacific northwest as a Husky to learn about the development of Merkel cells. Other than developmental biology, Tanya is also very interested in improving science education. She enjoys running, learning photography, and exploring the outdoors.
